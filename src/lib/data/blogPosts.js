			<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Understanding the Numbers</h2>

				Knowing what to measure is essential when you’re growing a product. Metrics like churn, lifetime value, and customer acquisition cost offer powerful insights into the health of your business. Without these numbers, decisions are just guesses.

			<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">The Metrics That Matter</h2>
			<p class="font-[550]">
				While there are many metrics to choose from, not all carry equal weight. Prioritize user engagement, conversion rates, and feature usage to truly understand how your product delivers value. These indicators guide you toward meaningful action.

			<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Applying the Insights</h2>
			<p class="font-[550]">
				Tracking metrics is only half the equation—what you do with them matters more. Use your data to validate ideas, improve user experiences, and spot areas of opportunity. Regular reviews lead to smarter decisions and more focused growth.
